# Amazon Room Scanner Project

## Overview
This project is a modern Amazon-inspired web application featuring an AI-powered room scanner. It combines a visually rich UI, responsive layouts, and advanced features such as WebXR-based room scanning and CLIP-powered AI recommendations. The project demonstrates both classic HTML/CSS approaches and a Next.js/React implementation for scalability and maintainability.
